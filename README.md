# ESP8266_SensorServer
Sensor server using the ESP8266 for DAQ and sensor control.

The ESP8266 is used to broadcast live-sensor data at a fixed rate to all clients that have been registered. The main idea of this project is to abstract the ESP8266 interfaces and create a framework to allow for an easy adaption to all kind of sensors.
